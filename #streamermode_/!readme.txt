remove the _ off the folder name (#streamermode_ to #streamermode) to enable streamer mode

this removes all possibly trackable information while playing the game whilst live

i also personally suggest you turn off chat (hud_saytext_time 0) and voice chat (voice_enable 0) alongside this

another suggestion: please fully restart your game before toggling this on/off, it screws with a lot of things.

also this isnt a guarantee that you wont be stream sniped, but it does make it harder for people to do so.
