![technohud-banner-github](https://i.imgur.com/RZXaqPR.png)

a clean hud made (mostly) from scratch with darker neutral colors as a theme.

this is a "legacy" version of the hud for people who dont feel like using log-base or want an easier base for editing

this version will only recieve updates if they are hud-breaking (not many, i guess)
